## Results/Findings

- Attrition by gender- There was a noticeable difference in attrition rates between genders. For example, 136 males and 76 females left the company, potentially indicating a need for gender-specific retention strategies.
  
- Attrition by age- Employees between the age of 26-35 showed higher attrition rates compared to older age groups (55+). This could indicate that younger employees may leave the company for career advancement opportunities or due to misalignment with job expectations.
  
- Attrition by salary- There was a trend indicating that the employees with lower salary (upto 5k) experienced higher attrition rates. Employees in higher salary brackets tended to have lower attrition rate, suggesting that competitive compensation may be an effective retention strategy.
  
- Attrition by working years- Employees with fewer years of service (less than 2 years) showed higher attrition. This might be attributed to the career growth expectations or job satisfaction levels in the early stages of employment.
  
- Attrition by job role- Out of 9 job roles in the company certain job roles exhibited significantly higher attrition rates, such as laboratory technician, sales executive, research scientist, sales representatives. This could be due to excessive workload in these roles.
